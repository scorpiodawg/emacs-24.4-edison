# emacs-24.4-edison

A build of emacs-24.4 for the Intel Edison IoT chip.

I looked everywhere for a build of emacs for the Edison chip (just an x86-32
processor) but couldn't find one so I compiled one myself on the board.

Built off of a download of the Emacs sources from gnu.org as of Feb 11, 2015.
